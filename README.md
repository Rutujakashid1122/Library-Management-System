# Library Management System

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a console-based Java application designed to manage books in a library. It allows users to **add, issue, return, and search books**, simulating the core operations of a real-world library.

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **encapsulation, classes, and objects**, while also practicing core Java fundamentals like **loops, conditional statements, and user input handling**.
